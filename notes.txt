errors:
    empty state struct variables crash showcase startup;
    params buffer needs seperate descriptor set


to-add later:
    unspliting in SBVH construction;
    add texture support from object to showcase;
    add feedback on ui actions
    scene construction
    buffers -> vector of buffers <SBVHNodes>
    construct TLAS for scene
    rotation + compute params;
    

tomorrow?
    finish up scene construction
    obj loading threads?
